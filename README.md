# mnist-neural-net
A small single hidden layered neural net I made to help me learn about how they work. I am using it to classify the MNIST database.

The [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) contains 60,000 28 x 28 images of handwritten numbers in its training set, and also 10,000 28 x 28 images of handwritten numbers in the test set.

 `loadMNISTImages.m` and `loadMNISTLabels.m` can be found at [http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/Using_the_MNIST_Dataset](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/Using_the_MNIST_Dataset). They are used to help me load the MNIST dataset
